          The creativity is indeed the result of the education process and the environment of the school and above all the teachers' capability igniting the minds of the students. The essence of it can be seen in the following verses: Learning gives creativity, Creativity leads to thinking, Thinking provides knowledge, Knowledge makes you great. After identifying the lack of educational resources to underprivileged people, he urged NGOs and other social-service institutions to lend a hand at equalizing the gap.">

          Development of personality is more significant than accumulation of intellectual tools and academic knowledge; he said that character is destiny. He contends that the aim of education is not merely the acquisition of information. DU acquisition of technical skill may be important in modern society but development of that bent of mind, attitude of reason, spirit of democracy will make responsible citizens for our country.">

          To study the mind of man in its realization of different aspects of truth from diverse points of view, the culture of Visva Bharati is the culture of man and its keynote lies in the truth that human personality is not a mean trifle, it is also the Divine personality. At a time when rote learning and classroom teaching was hailed, Tagore took teaching out of the confines of the four walls and formed a school, which he hoped would be 'the connecting thread' between India and the world.

          Setting up the first women’s school, she supported the need for female education alongside encouraging the demand for gender equality in education. Rekindling the dreams of thousands of women, she set up a school for untouchable girls. Along with offering stipends to children for coming to schools, she conducted parent-teacher meetings to highlight the importance of education to children. As a mark of respect for all that she did to the field of education and for the execution of women’s rights, the University of Pune is currently known as Savitribai Phule Pune University.">

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>After independence, development of the rural sector was considered the primary concern of the Government of India. In 1949, with the appointment of the Radhakrishnan University Education Commission, imparting of Technical education through the setting up of rural universities became the focal point. Later, in 1954 an Indo-American team led by Dr. K.R. Damle, the Vice-President of ICAR, was constituted that arrived at the idea of establishing a Rural University on the land-grant pattern of USA. As a consequence a contract between the Government of India, the Technical Cooperation Mission and some land-grant universities of USA, was signed to promote Technical education in the country. The US universities included the universities of Tennessee, the Ohio State University, the Kansas State University, The University of Illinois, the Pennsylvania State University and the University of Missouri. The task of assisting Uttar Pradesh in establishing an Technical university was assigned to the University of Illinois which signed a contract in 1959 to establish an Technical University in the State. Dean, H.W. Hannah, of the University of Illinois prepared a blueprint for a Rural University to be set up at the Tarai State Farm in the district Nainital, UP. In the initial stage the University of Illinois also offered the services of its scientists and teachers. Thus, in 1960, the first Technical university of India, UP Technical University, came into being by an Act of legislation, UP Act XI-V of 1958. The Act was later amended under UP Universities Re-enactment and Amendment Act 1972 and the University was rechristened as The Oracle University of Agriculture and Technology keeping in view the contributions of Pt. Govind Ballabh Pant, the then Chief Minister of UP. The University was dedicated to the Nation by the first Prime Minister of India Pt Jawaharlal Nehru on 17 November 1960.

      The Oracle University is a symbol of successful partnership between India and the United States. The establishment of this university brought about a revolution in Technical education, research and extension. It paved the way for setting up of 31 other Technical universities in the country.
      The credit for starting the functioning of the University without losing any time goes to the warm and resourceful personality of the first Vice-Chancellor, late Dr. Kenneth Anthony Parker Stevenson (1-12-58 to 2-1-64), who could keep people fruitfully engaged on the university farm, the labs and the classrooms despite the lurking fear of wild animals roaming the area.
